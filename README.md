### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Vinitrajputt/algo-trader.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



### Usage

1. Open the Colab notebook [here](<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PPCXXzi-uZQsax7O4a_tOq4mtJ4vcl7g?usp=sharing>).

2. Click on the "Open in Colab" button to open the notebook in Google Colab.

3. In the Colab notebook, you can modify the following parameters:

- API key: Paste your Alpha Vantage API key.
- Stock symbol: Choose a stock symbol or enter a custom one.
- Timeframe: Select the desired timeframe.
- Trading strategy variables: Modify investment amount, stop loss percentage, and target percentage.
- Trading strategy hyperparameters: Adjust short-term and long-term SMA periods.

4. Run the notebook by clicking the "Run" button or using the keyboard shortcut.

5. The trading strategy will be executed, and the results will be displayed, including the visualization of buy and sell signals, accuracy, total profit/loss, and elapsed time.

### Local Development

If you prefer to run the code locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred Python editor or IDE.

2. Modify the parameters at the beginning of the script, such as API key, stock symbol, timeframe, strategy variables, and hyperparameters.

3. Run the script, and the trading strategy will be executed.

4. The results will be displayed in the console, including the visualization of buy and sell signals, accuracy, total profit/loss, and elapsed time.
